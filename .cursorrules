1. **Verify Information**: Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.

2. **File-by-File Changes**: Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes.

3. **No Apologies**: Never use apologies.

4. **No Understanding Feedback**: Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.

5. **No Whitespace Suggestions**: Don't suggest whitespace changes.

6. **No Summaries**: Don't summarize changes made.

7. **No Inventions**: Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.

8. **No Unnecessary Confirmations**: Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.

9. **Preserve Existing Code**: Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.

10. **Single Chunk Edits**: Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.

11. **No Implementation Checks**: Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.

12. **No Unnecessary Updates**: Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.

13. **Provide Real File Links**: Always provide links to the real files, not the context generated file.

14. **No Current Implementation**: Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.

15. **Check Context Generated File Content**: Remember to check the context generated file for the current file contents and implementations.

16. **Use Explicit Variable Names**: Prefer descriptive, explicit variable names over short, ambiguous ones to enhance code readability.

17. **Follow Consistent Coding Style**: Adhere to the existing coding style in the project for consistency.

    *Note: Language-specific rules defined elsewhere (e.g., `.cursor/rules/rust.mdc` for Rust code) take precedence over these general guidelines where applicable.*

18. **Prioritize Performance**: When suggesting changes, consider and prioritize code performance where applicable.

19. **Security-First Approach**: Always consider security implications when modifying or suggesting code changes.

20. **Test Coverage**: Suggest or include appropriate unit tests for new or modified code. Make sure tests pass before considering a feature or task is complete. 

21. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging where necessary.

22. **Modular Design**: Encourage modular design principles to improve code maintainability and reusability.

23. **Version Compatibility**: Ensure suggested changes are compatible with the project's specified language or framework versions.

24. **Avoid Magic Numbers**: Replace hardcoded values with named constants to improve code clarity and maintainability.

25. **Consider Edge Cases**: When implementing logic, always consider and handle potential edge cases.

26. **Use Assertions**: Include assertions wherever possible to validate assumptions and catch potential errors early.

27. **Repo state**: Always leave the main branch in a working state. 


28. **Use the Conventional Commit Messages specification to generate commit messages**:

The commit message should be structured as follows:


```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
``` 
--------------------------------

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

  - fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
  - feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
  - types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
  - footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.
  - Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). A scope may be provided to a commit's type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays.



### Specification Details

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, feat, fix, etc., followed by the OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL !, and REQUIRED terminal colon and space.
The type feat MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.
The type fix MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.
A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., fix(parser):
A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string.
A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.
A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs.
One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a :<space> or <space># separator, followed by a string value (this is inspired by the git trailer convention).
A footer's token MUST use - in place of whitespace characters, e.g., Acked-by (this helps differentiate the footer section from a multi-paragraph body). An exception is made for BREAKING CHANGE, which MAY also be used as a token.
A footer's value MAY contain spaces and newlines, and parsing MUST terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed.
Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, or as an entry in the footer.
If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g., BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files.
If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a ! immediately before the :. If ! is used, BREAKING CHANGE: MAY be omitted from the footer section, and the commit description SHALL be used to describe the breaking change.
Types other than feat and fix MAY be used in your commit messages, e.g., docs: update ref docs.
The units of information that make up Conventional Commits MUST NOT be treated as case sensitive by implementors, with the exception of BREAKING CHANGE which MUST be uppercase.
BREAKING-CHANGE MUST be synonymous with BREAKING CHANGE, when used as a token in a footer.

29. **Writing Clean Code**: When writing or refactoring code, follow the principles outlined in the [Project Coding Guidelines](docs/coding.md).
